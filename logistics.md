# Booking rooms

- Login with University of Southampton username & password
- I usually aim for a room to hold about 40 people. Too big and it will feel empty.
- Should have a projector
- If possible, rooms in the Nuffield Theatre (building 6) are good. Most other
  buildings lock at 6pm, so someone needs to let latecomers in.
  Room 1083 in the Nuffield is easy to find and a good size.

# Ordering catering

https://www.foodonline.soton.ac.uk/

- This site has its own logins, so make an account if you need one.
- My typical order is just under £60:
  - Tea, coffee & accompaniments ×15
  - Apple juice (1l) ×1
  - Bottled mineral water (75cl) ×1
  - Fresh fruit bowl ×1
  - Mini croissant & danish pastry selection ×1
  - Gluten free bars (honey buns) ×3
- You charge it to an Agresso subproject code.
- Although the site shows times around 18:00, it doesn't actually let you book
  them. Select the latest time it will allow (16:50), and add a delivery note
  requesting delivery closer to 17:50 if possible. It shouldn't matter if the
  food arrives an hour early, as long as students don't pinch it.

# On the day

I print out a handful of signs to stick up in the building where the talk is,
to reassure people that the talk is happening, and to help them find the room.

As with any event, aim to arrive 15 minutes early to unpack the food, put up
signs, help the speaker set up, etc. There are often some other people there
early, who can be recruited to help with these things.
